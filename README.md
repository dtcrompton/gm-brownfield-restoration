# Greater Manchester Brownfield Restoration Potential

Geospatial analysis identifying former industrial sites with high ecological risk and suitability for nature-based remediation (mycoforestry/phytoremediation).

## Project Overview

This project uses satellite imagery and open environmental datasets to model contamination risk across Greater Manchester's industrial heritage sites. The analysis combines:
- Proximity to watercourses (contamination spread risk)
- Soil permeability (groundwater pollution potential)
- Terrain characteristics (slope, elevation)
- Current land cover (built-up and bare areas as brownfield indicators)

High-risk sites are prioritised for ecological assessment and nature-based restoration interventions.

## Tools & Data Sources

**Analysis:**
- Google Earth Engine (satellite data processing, spatial analysis)
- R (statistical analysis, visualisation)
- QGIS (cartographic output)
- Python (planned: interactive mapping, ML extension)

**Datasets:**
- ESA WorldCover (land cover, 10m resolution)
- WWF HydroSHEDS (river networks)
- OpenLandMap (soil texture/permeability)
- SRTM (elevation, terrain)

## Project Status

**Phase 1: GEE Foundation (Complete)**
- ✅ Study area definition (Greater Manchester)
- ✅ Environmental data layers integrated
- ✅ Composite contamination risk score generated

**Phase 2: Export & Analysis (In Progress)**
- Export risk raster and statistics
- R-based visualisation and site ranking
- Summary statistics by district

**Phase 3: Cartography (Planned)**
- QGIS final map production
- Site-specific case studies

**Phase 4: ML Extension (Planned)**
- Predictive model for restoration success
- Interactive Folium web map for stakeholders

## Next Steps

**Phase 2: Export & R Analysis**
1. Export risk score raster and zonal statistics from GEE
2. R-based visualisation (district summaries, site rankings)
3. Statistical analysis of high-priority zones

**Phase 3: Cartography**
4. QGIS final map production with case studies
5. Site-specific assessment examples

**Phase 4: Python Extension & ML**
6. Interactive Folium web map (stakeholder-facing: clickable sites with risk scores)
7. Predictive model: restoration success probability based on site characteristics
8. Model validation and 1-page stakeholder explainer
